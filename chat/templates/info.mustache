        At any time, you are a member of some number of channels indicated by the bars on the left side. Your
        current channel is colored blue. You can switch between channels by clicking on them, or by using the
        `p` and `q` shortcuts.

        ![channel view](/static/images/channel-general.png)

        Join a new channel by clicking the new channel button, indicated by the **+** sign.

        ![add a channel](/static/images/channel-add.png)

        You can leave channels by hovering over the channel button and clicking on the trash can. Similarly,
        can use the drag handle to reorder channels.

        ![reorder channels](/static/images/channel-reorder.png)

        You can link to channels by using the syntax `#channel-name` in your message. This will render as
        #channel-name, a link to that channel. Use this to invite people to join you in a different channel.

        The powered flight took a total of about eight and a half minutes. It seemed to me it had gone by in a
        lash. We had gone from sitting still on the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center to traveling at
        17,500 miles an hour in that eight and a half minutes. It is still mind-boggling to me. I recall
        making some statement on the air-to-ground radio for the benefit of my fellow astronauts, who had also
        been in the program a long time, that it was well worth the wait.

        * **What is this project?**

          Prat is an open-source chat program. You can see the project [on Github](//github.com/bkad/oochat).

        * **What does it mean when a username in the right-hand column is grayed out?**

          This indicates that the user is currently offline. When that user comes back online, he or she will
          be a member of this channel and will see any messages you have left in the meantime.

        * **Can I make a private channel?**

          No.

        * **Why are there no emoji?**

          [We know, we know.](//github.com/bkad/oochat/issues/17)

        * **Does Prat work in browsers other than Chrome?**

          Hell no.
